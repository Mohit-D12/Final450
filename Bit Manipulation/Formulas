Position of rightmost set bit 
    n & (~(n-1))

Invert bits from leftmost set bit
    n-1

Flip leftmost set bit
    n & (n-1)

Checking power of 2
    !(n & (n-1))

Position of MSB
    floor(log(n)/log(2)) + 1

Mask for kth bit from left
    1 << k

Checking kth bit set or not
    n & (1 << k) 

Mask from l to r [0 based lr]

    maskLength = (1ll << (r - l + 1)) - 1;
    mask = maskLength << l;

    //extract bits of n
    mask & n;
